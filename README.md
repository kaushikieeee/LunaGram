## 🎯 Why LunaGram?

I created LunaGram because Instagram doesn't have proper client support for macOS. I was tired of wasting battery by keeping a browser open just for a single Instagram tab. Here's what makes LunaGram better:

- **Battery efficient**: No more heavy browser overhead for one tab
- **Dedicated experience**: No distractions from other browser tabs
- **Native feel**: Looks and behaves like a true Mac app
- **Fast performance**: Optimized startup and lightweight footprint
- **Always ready**: Keep Instagram accessible without browser bloat
